A tribute to a one of remarkable Flash games, Strike Force Heroes.

## Background
In July 2017, [Adode announced that Flash player will be discontinued after December 31, 2020](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html). This announcement has led to some Flash games publisher stopped accepting new games (like [Kongregate.com](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311318/kongregate-stops-accepting-new-game-submissions-flash-discontinued-layoffs).

Strike Force Heroes, a Flash game made by Armor Games and Not Doppler, will be affected by this announcement. Therefore, Leif Clark (first initiator) wanted to make a sort of tribute to this game.
